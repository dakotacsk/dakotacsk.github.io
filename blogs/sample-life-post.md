# Reflections on Creative Practice

There's this idea floating around that technical work and creative work live in separate rooms. I've never found that to be true.

## The overlap

When I'm debugging a tricky ML pipeline, the process feels remarkably similar to sketching — you try something, step back, adjust, try again. Both require a kind of relaxed attention, a willingness to sit with uncertainty.

## Making space

The hardest part isn't the work itself. It's making space for it. Carving out time to experiment without a deadline, to build something just because it's interesting — that's the real discipline.

## A small manifesto

- Build things that make you curious
- Share before it's perfect
- Let your tools shape your thinking, but not limit it

The best creative work I've done has always come from the margins — side projects, late-night experiments, the stuff nobody asked for.
