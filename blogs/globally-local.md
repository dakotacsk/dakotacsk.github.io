# Globally Local: A Reflection on Local Democracy

## What is Local Democracy to Me

I often take things for granted. When I was a kid, I remember seeing notices from the district as I took the elevator up to my apartment. They would inform me of new mouse traps being placed around the area, a new stop sign being installed, and maintenance to update the fireproof paint and replace the leaking pipes. I remember believing that some magical schedule determined the dates of all these notices. I also recall my dad spending some of his Sundays at the apartment complex's Owners' Committee arguing over which vendor we should buy our scaffold nets from and how much we should spend on each construction project. I never understood the allure of spending your Sunday arguing with strangers when you could just stay at home and watch Phineas and Ferb.

As I grew older, I realised that these cumbersome meetings are often the force behind each community. Someone has to make the decisions, and that someone is most certainly not your city mayor – they are probably too busy preparing for their next campaign to worry about the installation of a stop sign in front of your local park. Often, it's the neighbour who ran against nobody for some select board you have never heard of. As I forced myself to start watching and reading local news that covers boring, two-hour-long town halls, I began to appreciate the time, energy, and effort that go into keeping a community functioning.

**Local democracy is often invisible, but to be functional, it must create its own visibility.** This visibility, I've learned, is not produced by formal institutions alone, but by the people who choose to participate, argue, and show up.

To me, local democracy is as big as your city, and as small as your HOA (in Hong Kong, these are government-recognized entities). Mostly, I've had the privilege of living in communities with rather functional forms of local governance, and I've noticed a few commonalities among those that thrive: Participation, Consistency, and Controversy.

Participation is the most obvious dimension. Without people showing up, nothing really happens. Even if the people who show up are uninformed or emotional, at least there is some sort of public presence in the decision-making process. Consistency is what keeps the system alive when nobody is paying attention – the regular scheduling of meetings, the existence of boards and committees, and the expectation that someone will still show up even if only three people care. Controversy and arguments, while often frustrating, seem to be what actually mobilize people. Nobody shows up when things are running smoothly. People show up when something feels wrong, unfair, or threatening.

## My Feelings Regarding Local Democracy

Recently, I started volunteering at the local news channel. Every Thursday, we run a 30-minute-long news session reporting on what happened in the past week. Around 10 minutes for high school sports, 10 minutes for upcoming events, and 10 minutes for town halls and select board meetings. The news packets for town halls are pretty boring most days, and no one really pays attention unless there's drama at the meeting. When I first started watching these summaries, I was irritated by people who came in with clearly uninformed opinions on certain proposals. But as time goes on, my bar is lowered, and I find myself craving any sort of participation from the general public.

My favorite story is the Envision Needham proposal, which aimed to redirect traffic and increase bike lanes. It initially struggled to gain public attention, despite outreach efforts by consultants. However, a controversial element of the plan, the removal of a bike lane, sparked significant debate on the local Needham Facebook page as the pilot launch approached. This ***controversy*** led to the creation of an opposition website, "NotOurVision," which ultimately increased ***participation*** in the subsequent select board meeting.

The words I would use to describe that select board meeting were "infuriating, frustrating, and entertaining." This proposal has long been in motion, and the business owners who showed up kept repeating the same arguments about traffic and decreased business visibility. In my eyes, this was a textbook example of NIMBYism – I can promise you they did not care until they realised that this would happen right outside their shop.

However, this was also the first time the Envision Needham proposal gained visibility among its stakeholders. The controversy increased the ***visibility*** and led to an influx of visitors to local news sites. Subsequently, they learned about the many other initiatives underway.

I am excited about a local democracy that consistently exists and functions, regardless of public interest; engages local stakeholders and encourages participation when it is challenging; and embraces drama and controversy, even if it causes delays. With many of my peers embracing the "digital nomad" lifestyle and choosing not to integrate into local communities, I can only hope that we don't lose the literacy to appreciate a functional local democracy. Otherwise, it may erode before we even realize what we've lost.

## What Am I to Local Democracy

I don't consider myself civically engaged in any way, shape, or form.

This might come as a surprise to a lot of my friends – I volunteer often, vote regularly, and keep up with both international and local news – but if you were to ask me to name my town's select board right now, I would not even know their initials.

I blame my background. I grew up in TaiKooShing, Hong Kong; attended high school in Andover, MA; am a resident of Burnaby, Vancouver, Canada; spend most of my time in Needham, MA; and reside in Wellesley, MA for most of the year. As one can imagine, that's a lot of local news and politics to catch up with daily. My struggle to call a place home is greatly reflected in my scattered knowledge of town politics and proposals. It's difficult to care about bike lanes when I stroll down the streets and see nothing that reminds me of my childhood or my culture. It's even more difficult to care when you know that in a few months you will be packing your bags and moving into a new and unknown community.

However, I recently started to wonder whether the inverse is true: my lack of civic engagement in local democracy is what causes this disconnect in my identity. As someone with "alien" status in America, I'm technically not allowed to volunteer, vote, or work without explicit permission from the government. My barriers to integration are both legal and cultural, and as my time in this community comes closer to ending every day, I have found it difficult to motivate myself to keep going.

In this class, I will bridge my cultural gap with American forms of local democracy by studying examples of other local governance systems and how to navigate the unknown. I'll show up to a town hall or two and make it a habit, or, better yet, meet friends there who will hold me accountable to caring. Hopefully, this will make integrating into a new community easier every time and prompt me to reflect on my civic engagement and stay accountable for fulfilling my civic duties.
