Benchmarked the model against various optimization methods, including Bayesian optimization and linear regression, to evaluate performance improvements and accuracy. Media : Pathfinding Algorithms Visualization Description : Developed a visualization tool for Q-learning and Dijkstra's algorithms, focusing on practical applications of reinforcement learning in navigation and optimization tasks. Media : Your browser does not support the video tag. HVAC System Optimization Description : Utilized ML and physics-based modeling to optimize energy use in air handling units (AHUs), integrating data science to enhance building sustainability. Project is currently being evaluated in the physical HVAC system of a building. Media : QEA2 - Laplacian Over Gaussian Operator Description : Developed a Python package for edge detection using the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) method to demonstrate image processing concepts in a QEA context. Includes customizable filters, example scripts, and teaching materials. Media : Data Science Journal Description : Documented data visualization projects using tools such as Python (pandas, matplotlib, etc.), Excel, and Tableau, creating interactive network graphs, animated graphs, and more. Skills : Data Engineering, Data Visualization Link : Data Science Journal The Phillipian State of The Academy Description : Led data analysis of a student survey with 80.5% participation, finding correlations using Python and libraries like pandas and numpy, and visualizing data.
