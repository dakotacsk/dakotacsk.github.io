                      The Phillipian received a participation rate of 80.5 percent of the
                      student body (956 participants). The anonymous survey asked a comprehensive
                      set of 156 questions.
                      To determine correlations, I spearheaded the team at The Phillipian and analyzed
                      the CSV file of all responses from Survey Monkey
                      with Python. I proceeded to use PANDAS,
                      matplotlib.plotly, and numpy libraries to find correlations
                      between each question.

                  I made this website based on <i>No Longer Human</i> written by Osamu Dazai.
                  I created this website in a gallery style using parralax scrolling to display
                  related images. I used a sharp pink as the highlighting color and included powerful
                  images from the manga adaptation of the book to convey the fear induced by Dazai's work.
                  In the website, I also included a summary of the book, fun facts, a song list based on
                  the main character, and notable quotes with analysis.

                  I created this website as a tribute to American author and short story writer, Nella Larsen.
                  This is created as a report for Black History Month. In the website, I included a biography of
                  Nella Larsen, a timeline of her achievements, a post highlighting related artists, and
                  an investigative piece titled "A Look Into Nella Larsen's Lack of Recognition During her Lifetime."
                  In the website, there are JavaScript powered vinyl players, an interactive landing page, and more.
                  It heavily features both writing and advanced JavaScript powered mechanisms.

                  I created a web-based puzzle game inspired by Margaret Atwood's
                  "Oryx and Crake," set in a post-apocalyptic world corrupted by
                  the internet. I wanted to create an immersive, techno-futuristic
                  experience, complete with a soundtrack and a visually striking,
                  hacker movie-inspired aesthetic. The game was written in the voice
                  of the main antagonist and explored his psyche. I enjoyed using game
                  development and computer science to express my artistic side and
                  bring my imagination to life.

                  We visit Boys and Girls Club @Lawrence weekly to teach around 40
                  children how to code.
                  As the coordinator, I started the robotics program and integrated Python
                  and HTML/CSS/JS into the program. I also worked with the Director of
                  Digital Arts at the club and expanded the robotics section from 1 robot
                  to more than 10 robots, allowing more children to learn coding through
                  robotics.

                  I created a website with a decision tree detailing my favorite
                  headphones for each price point and usage. I also wrote a one sentence
                  review for many headphones and ranked them based on different factors. 
                  This project has aided many of my friends in choosing a pair of 
                  headphones and regularly recieves traffic from other popular head-fi discussion platforms.

                  Created this chart as a part of my CSC630 project. I have always been a big fan 
                  of graphic novels and wanted to explore the most classic issues from the franchise. 
                  Since Marvel plays with collaboration between heroes a lot, I decided a network 
                  graph to connect them would be interesting to create. I am looking to expand the 
                  graph in the future and continue this project.

              Few realize the ubiquity and influence of AI algorithms in our lives.
              This workshop will 1) address the fact that AI's influence is invisible to most
              of us; 2) show how AI is biased against women and people of color in largely
              invisible ways, and 3) introduce participants to the great advocacy out there on
              the legislative and grassroots level seeking to address racial and gender bias

            <h3>MLK Jr. Day Workshop - Good Design is Accessible: Accessibility in Technology</h3>
            <p>Date: January 16, 2023</p>
            <p>My Role: One of 3 Presenters and proposal writers.</p>
            <p>Purpose:
              <br>
              Our workshop, "Good Design is Accessible: Accessibility in Technology" aims to
              raise awareness about the barriers that people with disabilities face when using
              technology. We will discuss the importance of accessibility in technology, and
              provide practical tips and tools for making technology more accessible—such as
              changing the interface of websites, considering screen reader text, having reasonable
              font sizes, and making it easier for website to load for those with less access
              to internet bandwidth. Participants will have the opportunity to learn about
              accessibility guidelines and checker tools, and to try out these tools for
              themselves. Through interactive activities and discussions, participants
              will gain a better understanding of the challenges that people with disabilities
              face when using technology, and how they can help to create a more inclusive and
              ccessible digital world. This workshop is designed for people of all levels of
              experience, and is suitable for anyone who is interested in learning more about
              accessibility in technology.

            <h3>CS Paper - Multilingualism in NLP</h3>
            <p>Date: November 9, 2021</p>
            <p>My Role: Writer</p>
            <p>Purpose:
              <br>
              In this essay I discuss the following: <br>
              Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that
              deals with human-computer interaction using human language. It is used in various
              technologies such as Google Translate, chatbots and autocorrect. However, NLP often
              focuses on English and other Western languages, leaving out non-English speakers and
              perpetuating class divides. NLP also relies on Western techniques such as stemming and
              character separation, which do not work for languages like Chinese and Japanese. Lack
              of data for non-Western languages and the use of NLP in fields like law disproportionately
              affect non-native English speakers. It is important for those building NLP systems to
              acknowledge and address these issues to create more inclusive technology.

            <p>Purpose:
              <br>
              In this essay I discuss the following: <br>
              A.I. is becoming more accessible with free services like Google Colab and cloud computing
              rentals, and websites like Kobra Studio simplify coding. It is important to learn about
              A.I. in order to be responsible consumers and to be at the forefront of its use in various
              fields, including computer science, marketing, finance, politics, law, medicine, and
              literature. Even if someone's grandma may not be able to master A.I., anyone with internet
              access can learn about it.
