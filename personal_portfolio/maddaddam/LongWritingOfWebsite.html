Oryx was tasked with flower selling and later with luring pedophiles into a hotel room with hidden cameras where Uncle N would then blackmail those who entered the hotel room with Oryx. After approximately 12 years, Uncle N crossed the wrong person and was murdered, causing Oryx to be sold to another sex-trafficking mob, working under a cameraman named Jack. She was featured in over 250 videos and streams and is estimated to have grossed 500k views and 100k in profit. Oryx claimed to have learned English by exchanging sexual favors with Jack before being sold to a couple in San Francisco and continuing her career there. Afterward, she traveled in the pleeblands and worked in many brothels. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A change came in&hellip; me, which changed her life for the better. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jimmy and I first saw Oryx on a child pornography site.
