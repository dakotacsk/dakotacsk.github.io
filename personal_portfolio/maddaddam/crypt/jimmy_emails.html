Jimmy sent me an email today. He complained about how Martha-Graham looked horrible. With his grades, he should be <i>grateful</i> for a bed. <br>
<br>
Email 1:<br>
<br>
I told him about Watson-Crick&rsquo;s student suites and rocks. He seemed displeased. <br>
<br>
Email 2: <br>
<br>
We decided to play some 3D chess. It is weird to not have Jimmy around me. I wonder if we will lose touch. <i>No love loss there.</i> <br>

Jimmy complained about his new girlfriend (is this his 17th? I may be good with numbers, but I can&rsquo;t keep track of them). He hated that she said he was too childish. I don&rsquo;t understand why Jimmy wastes his time on girls who do art; they are an anomaly in the biological sense.<br>

Jimmy started a new job at the academy&rsquo;s library. He sorts the old books for the library. I don&rsquo;t quite understand his job, considering most books are online nowadays. However, he does seem like he is enjoying it. Let&rsquo;s hope that his role won&rsquo;t be <u>eliminated</u> by the lack of demand.<br>

Jimmy got a job in AnooYoo. It is a terrible company. He should have gotten a better job. <br>

Email 764:<br>
<br>
Jimmy broke up with his girlfriend. She made art about him with the word &ldquo;love.&rdquo; Why would she waste so much effort on a guy who manipulates and exploits her? Female artists are truly freaks of nature.<br>

The email did not say anything, but it is clear he is sad. I assume the CorpSeCorps already showed him the video of his mother&rsquo;s execution. It might be time to bring him into RejoovenEssence and tell him the plan about <s>building a new world, </s>the BlyssPluss pill.<br>
<br>
Email 813:<br>
<br>
I think it is time for me to visit him. I&rsquo;ve decided, he shall take care of the Newmans, or &ldquo;Crakers,&rdquo; as Oryx calls them. <br>
