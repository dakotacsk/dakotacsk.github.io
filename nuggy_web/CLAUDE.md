Refer to the following style guide for all design decisions:

What do I want to be known for?
Disrupting the industry
Take the thin margins of the cannabis industry and turn it into profitable ones through technology in the frontier.
Seamless
Easy to use. This tool should not be complicated.
Trust and Compliance
We want them to be able to trust us with their data and know we will be compliant.
Who do I want to talk to?
Existing POS systems (so they would let us integrate our tool into their’s, eventually to exit to them)
Dispensaries who might use our service to dynamically price their products
Eventually, cultivation site
1 Brand Character
Attribute
What It Means
How to Show It
Friendly Disruptor
We shake up thin margins—but with a smile, never arrogance.
Rounded letterforms, approachable micro-copy (“Need a hand?” vs. “Error 401”).
Seamless
The product should feel invisible until needed.
Low-friction flows (1-click publish), calm color palette, minimal form fields.
Data-Driven Growth
Pricing is evidence-based; arrow motif = rising margins.
Up-and-to-the-right arrow on CTA hovers, subtle upward animations in data viz.
Trust & Compliance
Cannabis data is sensitive.
Tight permissions UI, clear audit trails, Deep Forest accents for legal/compliance screens.
