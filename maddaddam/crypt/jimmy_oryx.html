<p><u>Jimmy and Oryx</u><br>
  <br>
  Meeting 0:<br>
  Jimmy saw Oryx for the first time today. It is clear that his affection for her has not changed. He has always been bothered by sexual nature, so I supposed I will be his student service this time round. <br>
  <br>
  Meeting 1:<br>
  Jimmy and Oryx had sexual intercourse today. I do not know how I feel about it.<br>
  <br>
  Meeting 5:<br>
  Jimmy kept asking Oryx to explain her backstory to him. I highly doubt Oryx enjoyed it. They seem to be the only two neurotypicals on the compound. <br>
  <br>
  Meeting 12:<br>
  Jimmy wondered if I knew about this relationship. Of course I did? I built this place. If I can find out about AnooYoo why would I not know about something happening in my compound? He really is oblivious.<br>
  <br>
  Meeting 19:<br>
  Oryx said that sex with me is not fun. If this is a jab at me to spice things up, I would like her to know I have no interest in investing more unnecessary energy into sexual intercourse.<br>
  <br>
  Meeting 55:<br>
  Oryx told Jimmy to take care of the Crakers today. I wonder how much of my plan she has deduced.<br>
