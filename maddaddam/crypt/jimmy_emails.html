Jimmy sent me an email today. He complained about how Martha-Graham looks horrible. <br>
<br>
Email 1:<br>
<br>
I told him about Watson-Crick, he seemed to be displeased with his school.<br>
<br>
Email 2: <br>
<br>
We decided to play some 3D chess. It is weird to not have Jimmy around me. I wonder if we will loose touch.<br>

Email 201:<br>
<br>
Jimmy complained about his new girlfriend. He hated that she said he was too childish. I don&rsquo;t understand why Jimmy wastes his time on girls who do art, they are an anomaly in the biological sense.<br>

Jimmy started a new job at the academy&rsquo;s library. He enjoys reading old books, he might know a lot of old words. He has always been good at understanding emotions of the general public. I wonder if he will be good at Problematics.<br>

Jimmy got a job in AnooYoo. It is a terrible company, he should have gotten a better job. <br>

Email 764:<br>
<br>
Jimmy broke up with his girlfriend. She made art about him with the word &ldquo;love.&rdquo; I wonder why.<br>

Email 812:<br>
<br>
The email did not say anything, but it is clear he is sad. I wonder if the video of his mom&rsquo;s execution reached him yet. It might be time to bring him in to RejoovenEssence and tell him the plan about building a new world the BlyssPluss pill.<br>
<br>
Email 813:<br>
<br>
I think it is time for me to visit him. He shall take care of the NewHumans, or &ldquo;Crakers&rdquo; as Oryx call them. <br>
