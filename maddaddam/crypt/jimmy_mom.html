  Jimmy&rsquo;s Mom<br>
  <br>
  Jimmy&rsquo;s mom left today. I realized her plan a few weeks ago, but I don&rsquo;t think Jimmy expected it. I don&rsquo;t understand why she took the rakunk. She knows it is an invasive species. Here is a log of her activities:<br>
  <br>
  Week 0:<br>
  She escaped to the pleebands with a guard. Her plan is well executed. CorpSeCorps will not be able to catch her for a while.<br>
  <br>
  Week 12:<br>
  She visited a genetic modification clinic today and changed her hair color. She is less recognizable now.<br>
  <br>
  Week 30:<br>
  She is investigating God&rsquo;s Gardener. She realized their structure and chaos were even more corrupt than they seemed.<br>
  <br>
  Week 45:<br>
  She participated in her first protest.<br>
  <br>
  Week 204:<br>
  The Happicuppa Coffee conflict is on the international level now. Jimmy&rsquo;s mom secured a high-ranking position in God&rsquo;s Gardener by navigating the conflict well.<br>
  <br>
  Week 334:<br>
  She is currently a leading force against the international troops and is hidden from public view. It will be harder to track her from now on.<br>
  <br>
  Week 406:<br>
  I found God Gardener&rsquo;s internal database. Jimmy&rsquo;s mom is more influential than I realized. If we had met earlier, I would have asked her to join me in creating the perfect pill.<br>
  <br>
  Week 420:<br>
  She was executed. The video will reach Jimmy soon. I shall plan accordingly.<br>
