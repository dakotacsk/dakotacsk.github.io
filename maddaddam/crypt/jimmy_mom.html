  <u><i>Jimmy&rsquo;s Mom<br></i></u>
  <br>
  Jimmy&rsquo;s mom left today. I realised her plan a few weeks ago, but I don&rsquo;t think Jimmy expected it. I don&rsquo;t understand why she took the rakunk. She knows it is an invasive species. Here is a log of her activities:<br>
  <br>
  <u>Week 0:</u><br>
  She escaped to the pleebands with a guard. Her plan is well executed. CorpSeCorps will not be able to catch her for a while.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Week 12:</u><br>
  She visited a genetic modification clinic today and changed her eye color. She is less recognizable now.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Week 30:</u><br>
  She is investigating God&rsquo;s Gardener. She realised their structure and chaos is even more corrupt than it seems.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Week 45:</u><br>
  She participated in her first protest.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Week 204:</u><br>
  The Happicuppa Coffee conflict is on the international level now. Jimmy&rsquo;s mom secured a high ranking position in God&rsquo;s Gardener by natvigating the conflict well.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Week 334:</u><br>
  She is currently a leading force against the international troops, and is hidden from public view. It will be harder to track her form now on.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Week 406:</u><br>
  I found God Gardener&rsquo;s internal database. Jimmy&rsquo;s mom is more influential than I realised. If we met earlier I would have asked her to join me in creating the perfect pill.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Week 420:</u><br>
  She was executed. The video will reach Jimmy soon. I shall plan accordingly.<br>
