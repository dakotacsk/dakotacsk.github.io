  <u>TO THE PUBLIC:<br></u>
  <br>
  Has your girlfriend ever complained about sex lasting only two minutes? Have you ever been told to &ldquo;man up&rdquo;? Or have you ever wished you had a pill that could give you unlimited stamina?<br>
  <br>
  Then wait no more&mdash; if you want uninhibited, limitless sexual desire, masterful sexual prowess, protection against all STDs, and prolonged youth, try the <u><i>BlyssPluss pill!</i></u> Developed by the leading scientists in RejoovenEssence, the pill utilizes the newest nano-genetic fortifying technology to rejuvenate your cytoplasm and is <i>guaranteed</i> to work!<br>
  <br>
  <u>TO INVESTORS:<br></u>
  <br>
  For the longest time, humanity has been waiting for a way to genetically maximize our potential. We have attempted and failed through selective mating, gene-editing, eugenics, and more, but now we will make gene-maxing a reality with the newest BlyssPluss x Newmans plan. <br>
  <br>
  Step 1: The BlyssPluss pill<br>
  <br>
  It has long been theorized that the tragedy of war and crime is simply misplaced sexual energy, and with the BlyssPluss pill, users will finally be able to utilize all of their sexual potential for the betterment of their species. The pill gives its users uninhibited, limitless sexual desire, masterful sexual prowess, protection against all STDs, and prolonged youth&ndash; everything the average human could want. <br>
  <br>
  However, we know how important population control is to our shareholders, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve decided to put the power in your hands. RejoovenEssence has not only created the perfect pill for sexual potential but one for contraception as well, unbeknownst to our customers and only known to our shareholders. <br>
  <br>
  Step 2: Newmans<br>
  <br>
  Using the newest clustered interspaced short palindromic technology, the Newmans can be described as customization at its finest. Through a survey, consumers can choose skin color, eye color, intelligence level, interests, and more, creating their version of the perfect human. With the BlyssPluss pill inhibiting population growth, there would also be a massive demand for the Newmans, allowing them to integrate into society and be the new force of the future.<br>
  <br>
  <u>PRIVATE<br></u>
  <br>
  Step 3: BlyssPluss pill plague<br>
  <br>
  I&rsquo;ll leave a map in the desk drawer for Jimmy to find. He <i>should</i> be smart enough to choose a place with trees for the &ldquo;Crakers.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll also make sure that Jimmy is in the compound with the &ldquo;Crakers&rdquo; so someone can take care of them when the plague is released. <br>
  <br>
  Step 4:<br>
  <br>
  Find Oryx. That should be easy enough with the tracking chip in her. The hard part is to kill her in front of Jimmy. I&rsquo;m sure she guessed half of the plan all along &ndash; no one is as oblivious as Jimmy. Hopefully, she won&rsquo;t be too mad. <br>
  <br>
  Step 5:<br>
  <br>
  Die. <br>
  <br>
  Step 6:<br>
  <br>
  Hope that Jimmy and his damned compassionate heart will stay alive for the &ldquo;Crakers&rdquo;. He has to, right? After all the brainwashing Oryx and I have done. I hope she&rsquo;s managed to give him at least a few errant brain cells.<br>
  <br>
  Step 7:<br>
  <br>
  Jimmy will lead the &ldquo;Crakers&rdquo; to the designated area. The &ldquo;Crakers&rdquo; will live forever as my legacy.<br>
