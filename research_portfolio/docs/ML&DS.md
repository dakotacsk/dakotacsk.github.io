### NeoViews - Predicting Soccer Player Locations

- **Description**: Developed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to accurately predict soccer player locations throughout an entire match, achieving a prediction accuracy within 10 meters. Benchmarked the model against various optimization methods, including Bayesian optimization and linear regression, to evaluate performance improvements and accuracy.

### HVAC System Optimization

- **Description**: Utilized ML and physics-based modeling to optimize energy use in air handling units (AHUs), integrating data science to enhance building sustainability. This includes leveraging an ensemble model (GBR, LSTM, Batch-RL, etc.) to create the best result for the complex system. Project is currently being evaluated in the physical HVAC system of a building.
